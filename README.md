Code for Towards Understanding and Improving GFlowNet Training, ICML 2023.
This code is provided as-is and intended as a reference for how our GFlowNet improvement proposals were implemented, and how experiments were performed. While it can serve as a basis for a package, it is not intended for this purpose, as some of our coding choices traded off increased flexibility in GFlowNet design for experimentation, at the cost of runtime speed.
